# Security Log Analysis with Python
Project for security log analysis

## Objective
Analyze authentication logs to identify suspicious login activity, such as repeated failed login attempts that may indicate brute-force attacks.

## Tools Used
- Python 3
- Simulated Linux authentication logs

## Project Overview
This project parses authentication log files and counts failed login attempts per IP address. IPs with three or more failed attempts are flagged as suspicious.

## Key Learnings
- Understanding authentication log structures
- Basic security event detection logic
- Applying Python for security analysis
